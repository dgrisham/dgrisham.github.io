Class materials for CSCI 400 -- Programming Languages at Colorado School of Mines

**Students**: It is recommended that you clone this repository and periodically
pull it for updates (that will allow you to get the most up-to-date code samples
and PDFs in a straightforward manner). However, as noted in the [Assignments and
Class-exercises](#assignments-and-class-exercises) section below, many of the
(non-slides) Markdown (`.md`) files are best viewed in Github (Github renders
them nicely, and the intra-repo hyperlinks will work as well).

# Notes

## Slides

The [slides](slides) can be viewed on Github -- however, **Github renders the
`slides.pdf` files as images, so you won't be able to highlight text or click
any of the links**. The easiest thing to do would be to clone the repo and run
your own PDF viewer on your local copies of the slides. Otherwise, you can open
the source `slides.md` Markdown files where you can copy any of the text/links.
However, the `slides.md` files will have a lot of embedded Latex and will look
fairly ugly.

## Assignments and Class Exercises

The [assignments](assignments) and [class\_exercises](class_exercises) folders
contain Markdown files that Github can render nicely for you, so it's best to
view them in Github itself. These files will also include links to other files
in this repository, which will also be work well within Github. You can also
view these (and any of the `.md` files) in a regular ol' text editor, and they
will look fairly clean (aside from the `slides.md` files, as mentioned above).
