Meetup Presentations
====================

Purpose
-------

Explore the local community of language/programming afficionados.

Preparation
-----------

1.  Review this [list of local
    meetups](https://www.meetup.com/topics/computer-programming/us/co/denver/),
    or search around to find others.
2.  Find some classmates who want to attend the same meetup. Ideally, we'll have
    3-5 students attend a meetup together. There will be a thread on Piazza for
    finding groups if you don't have one.
3.  Please **do not** select a 'hack' type of event. These tend to not be very
    interesting to attend just once (better if you're part of the community) and
    the reports on these events don't tend to be very informative.
4.  **Your group should submit a single Pull Request**([how
    to](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork/))
    to the course Github repo with your meeting name/date and group member names
    added to the [Schedule table below](#schedule). Leave the Presentation Date
    column blank; your entry should look something like this:

Meeting                     | Meeting Date | Presentation Date | Students
-------                     | :----------: | :---------------: | --------
Boulder Haskell Programmers | 9/6          |                   | Kevin Shields, Bilinda Butcher

You can find more info on how to format tables in Github-flavored Markdown
[here](https://help.github.com/articles/organizing-information-with-tables/).
Please keep the formatting of the table fairly clean (e.g. line up the pipe
separators for each column), but that may get difficult with multiple groups
pushing at once (not a big deal).

**Please make your pull request with your meetup entry by Sunday, September
3rd.**

Presentation Details
--------------------

Presentations are worth **10 points**. They should be **\~5-10 minutes** in
length and should include a few slides, which cover:

-   Meeting details (what, when, where)
-   What did you learn? Would you go to another meetup, with either the same
    group or a different one?
